# PoseTimer
An app built on the original PoseFinder app by Apple.
This app is able to:
1. detect and count the number of people in frame and display on screen
2. detect and count the number of people sitting or standing and display on screen

I have also added a timer function that displays
1. timing of the person in frame
2. timing of when the person is sitting
3. timing of when the person is standing

The timer function works well for one person as the data can just be displayed on screen
For multiple people, it is difficult to display numerous data on screen so 
it will be better to enlist the help of a dictionary 
to collate the data and print it on console or upload it into a file

This is a simple version for your own use, 
perhaps you wish to track how much time you are sitting or standing while working etc.

I may be uploading more improved versions of it.

A limitation of PoseFinder is that it cannot detect a person if their back is facing the camera
